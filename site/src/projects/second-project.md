### Task

The task was to create a proof-of-concept program to simulate registering for parking spaces at a given parking lot and display data pertaining to the occupation of the parking lot (i.e. who is in what space, and information regarding the person and their vehicle). This was also to be done in a website-like format.

### Solution

The end product of this project was a proof-of-concept program that was web-hosted using Flask. The program itself held multiple pre-fabricated data-sets that were accessible via a drop-down menu and the site itself demonstrated basic-front end development as well as performing the task of operating as a proof-of-concept of storing and displaying data pertaining to the occupation of a parking lot.
