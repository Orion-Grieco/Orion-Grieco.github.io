## Brief
* I chose an extended C.V. format, and I believe it fits my goals for a C.V. as it is a neat and organized format wherein the information is easy-to-digest and easily comprehendible. It also allows for easy alterations when or if I will have to do so in the future, as well as that it fits the suggested format in the `UNC Writing Center Guide`. It also contains information from my existing resume and formats it well, which as another goal I had wanted to achieve: to reformat the information from my resume into the C.V. document.

### Future actions to add new material to the C.V.
* Attempt to enter into an internship
* Strengthen understanding of currently or previously used languages.
* Work on past projects and develop them into more fleshed-out programs.
